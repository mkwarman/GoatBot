# GoatBot
A simple IRC utility bot

A more in depth readme will come soon. For now, the bot is built in such a way that portability is only partially implemented.
Future plans involve setting it up to be run in other customized environments without having to change source code.

Changelog:

0.X

Testing and development


1.0:

Added final core features, fixed bugs and made goatbot overall userful


Future Plans:

goatbot, announce [channel] [message]
Warning/Kick/Ban forgiveness
  After a certian amount of time goes by, warnings kick or bans may be forgotten in an attempt to forgive previous offenders.
goatbot, list online/offline users
Improved command recognition
Ability to save userlists, possibly in a MySQL database (or text file in the shorter term)
